# Speech-Emotion-Detection
Welcome to the Speech Emotion Detection project! We combine NLP and deep learning to classify emotions from speech. Using Librosa for MFCC feature extraction and a pre-trained .h5 model, we ensure accurate results. SpeechRecognition adds transcription, while Streamlit_webrtc enables real-time analysis, supporting formats like .wav, .mp3, and .opus.
